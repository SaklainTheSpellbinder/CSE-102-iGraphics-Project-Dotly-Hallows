## Game Overview

In **Dotly Hallows**, players take on the role of Harry Potter, racing through magical mazes, collecting **Golden Snitches**, and facing off against terrifying **Dementors** and the deadly **Basilisk**. Each level presents new challenges and twists, building up to a shocking climax that leads Harry to a chilling fate.

## Level Breakdown

### **Level 1: The Snitch Chase**

Harry begins with the **Sorting Hat power-up**, allowing him to temporarily destroy **Dementors** in his path. The maze is filled with **Golden Snitches**, and Harry must race to collect them while avoiding Dementors that are hot on his trail.

### **Level 2: The Darkening Maze**

The maze grows more treacherous as **Basilisks** emerge from the shadows, adding a whole new level of danger. The Sorting Hat’s power-up starts to run out, and the clock is ticking. Can you collect all the Snitches before the darkness overcomes you?

### **Level 3: The Final Quest**

Forget about Snitches—now it’s all about reaching the **Triwizard Cup**! But as Harry moves toward his goal, the maze begins to warp, the shadows grow darker, and the power-up fades. Can you make it to the Cup before it’s too late?

## Victory or… Something Else?

You reach the **Triwizard Cup** and think you've won it all. But the moment you touch it, the magic surges, and everything changes. The cheering stops. The fireworks die.

You’re no longer in the maze. You’re standing in the **Graveyard of Little Hangleton**, where eerie whispers fill the air and the shadows grow longer. The game doesn’t end here—it leaves you hanging on the edge of a much darker mystery.

## Features

- **Sorting Hat Power-Up**:  
  The Sorting Hat gives Harry temporary invincibility, allowing him to **destroy Dementors**. The power-up’s duration decreases with each level:
  - **Level 1**: 9 seconds
  - **Level 2**: 7 seconds
  - **Level 3**: 5 seconds

- **Enemies**:  
  - **Dementors**: The enemies relentlessly chase Harry through the maze. Use your Sorting Hat power-up to destroy them temporarily, or avoid them altogether.
  - **Basilisk**: The ultimate danger! The Basilisk cannot be destroyed, and touching it means instant death.

- **Magical Effects**:  
  - **Power-ups** come with magical sound effects and dazzling visuals when used to destroy Dementors.
  - **Dementors** leave behind an eerie **poof sprite** when defeated.

- **Graveyard Twist**:  
  After reaching the Triwizard Cup, Harry finds himself transported to the **Graveyard of Little Hangleton**, a dark and mysterious place that raises more questions than answers.

## How to Die (Not Recommended)

- Collide with a **Dementor** without the Sorting Hat power-up.
- Get too close to the **Basilisk**—one touch and it’s game over!
- Stand still and let the enemies close in on you.
